**This is a modified version of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe),[Caffe-enet
](https://github.com/TimoSaemann/caffe-enet/tree/22d356c956cdc5e752e6d40612e4f6c60fc8f471/) and [PSPNet](https://github.com/hszhao/PSPNet/)

The interp layer in [PSPNet](https://github.com/hszhao/PSPNet/) was combined into [caffe-enet
](https://github.com/TimoSaemann/caffe-enet/tree/22d356c956cdc5e752e6d40612e4f6c60fc8f471/). And CuDNN5.0 in [caffe-enet
](https://github.com/TimoSaemann/caffe-enet/tree/22d356c956cdc5e752e6d40612e4f6c60fc8f471/) has been updated to CuDNN6.0.
